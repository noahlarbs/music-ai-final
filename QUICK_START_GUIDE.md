1. Go to: https://colab.research.google.com/github/magenta/magenta-realtime/blob/main/notebooks/magenta_rt_demo.ipynb
2. Run the demo to see real AI guitar generation
3. No changes to your files needed

**Result**: See what real AI guitar solos sound like

### **Option 2: Update Your Existing App (Recommended)**
**What**: Add Magenta RealTime to your current web app
**How**: 
1. Update `api_server.py` with new code
